  From:
  Environment=CATALINA_OPTS=
  To:
  Environment=CATALINA_OPTS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005

- journalctl -u tomcat10.service --since "3 min ago"

- . /home/dev/Documents/commander/dev/deploy.sh && sudo systemctl restart tomcat10

- ignore unrecognized/unsupported arguments (as opposed to returning 400)

- always assume that Authentication is TokenAuthenticationToken

- removing from List returned from repository does not affect database

- database is not affected until method returns in a transactional class

TODO

- custom HTTP responses for all errors (404, 405, etc)
