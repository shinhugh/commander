- ignore unrecognized/unsupported arguments (as opposed to returning 400)

- always assume that Authentication is TokenAuthenticationToken

- removing from List returned from repository does not affect database

- database is not affected until method returns in a transactional class

TODO

- custom HTTP responses for all errors (404, 405, etc)

- only allow one WebSocket connection per account to send/receive game data
  multiple connections per account can exist, but only one will be used for game

- if a time period passes with no input from client, reset certain properties
  under corresponding player (e.g. movement)
